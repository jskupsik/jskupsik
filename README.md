Hello, I'm Jakub Kupsik. Welcome to my github portfolio.

I am a software developer looking for work (Los Angeles, CA or REMOTE), with experience primarily in Java, Kotlin, and Javascript!

Here you can find code/demos of my favorite projects:

- AltruisticDrivingAssist, my senior thesis project. A dashboard mobile app which uses ML-based real time computer vision to provide the driver with freeway speed recommendations to improve traffic flow. Minimize stop-and-go behavior and improve merging.

- LaRaza Centro Legal website, built for a nonprofit using HTML and CSS.

- CommuterStudy, a school project. A hands-free flashcard web application that uses voice recognition and text to speech to read questions and provide feedback on verbal answers.

- Iron Armada, an indie video game I worked on for 3 years. Built from the ground up using Java and Kotlin.
