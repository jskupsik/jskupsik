Hello, I'm Jakub Kupsik. Welcome to my github portfolio.

I am a software developer looking for work (Los Angeles, CA or REMOTE), with experience primarily in Java, Kotlin, and Javascript!

Here you can find code/demos of my favorite projects:

- AltruisticDrivingAssist, my senior thesis project. A dashboard mobile app which uses ML-based real time computer vision to provide the driver with freeway speed recommendations to improve traffic flow. Minimize stop-and-go behavior and improve merging. <Working on finding, cleaning, and uploading full app code to portfolio>

- LaRaza Centro Legal website, built for a nonprofit using HTML and CSS using wordpress templates. https://lrcl.org/

- CommuterStudy, a school project. A hands-free flashcard web application that uses voice recognition and text to speech to read questions and provide feedback on verbal answers. CODE: https://github.com/cs480-projects/cs480-projects.github.io/tree/master/teams-fall2017/SnackOverflow
DEMO: http://cs480-projects.github.io/teams-fall2017/SnackOverflow/index.html

- Card-Game-Project, my most recent project, currently heavily work-in-progress. Built using React.js and Node.js, it will be a simple web-based multiplayer card game kind of like blackjack. https://github.com/Imacds/card-game-project

My more casual/video game repository is https://github.com/Imacds, but it isn't the most active.
